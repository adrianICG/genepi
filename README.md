# genepi
Bancroft level 7 collaborative repository.

This repository would ideally contain all standard scripts or pieces of code we use exhaustively in genepi. We currently have available:

* The PRS pipeline made by runPRSv2, PRSlmm and plotPRS
* A couple of GWAS scripts
* Python utility functions for working with HPC. This should enable everyone to develop standard scripts
* A script for running common factor GWAS using GenomicSEM

The idea is for this to be a shared repository where people can contribute and raise issues. This will also help keep track of versions etc etc.
